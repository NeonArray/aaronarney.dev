tl;dr - don't bother reading this.

So years ago I had read advice or a book or something about self-promotion and branding. I also had thought
I was going to be a dedicated freelancer at the time, so through some creative exercises came up with the
name Ocular-Rhythm. Nothing ever really came of it, but I just kept using the name because I thought it was
cool.

Then I realized that Ocular-Rhythm just isn't synonymous with my name. I'm not a famous developer, nor do I
strive or intend to be one. Point is, the name's a bit pointless to me now. I will keep it and don't plan
on changing it out in places I use it, but will probably convert my logos etc to use my name instead.

## The Site

The site is built with Gatsby and TypeScript with content being sourced from markdown files. I had originally built this site a year or two ago but then had switched it to WordPress for a short spell. Anyway, I'm back to Gatsby.

I had toyed with re-sourcing from WordPress using the REST API, and thought it would be cool to use WordPress as a headless CMS. After getting everything setup I decided I didn't want to keep pursuing that approach. Mainly because I did not want to import Gutenberg blocks and then have to set up all the CSS styles for various blocks, using the WordPress CSS class names.
